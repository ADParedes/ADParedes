**I have a Ph.D. in Bioengineering, and I have a passion for open science.**

Like open-source software development, where a community of volunteers who believe in the good of the software contribute their precious time to building upon it,  **I can see world where citizen scientists contribute to open science projects to interrogate a research question, data process, and analyze data in digestible batches with other citizen scientists in other parts of the world, all in the comfort of their home**
