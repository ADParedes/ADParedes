### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Andre
#### Open biomedical science and clinical data science enthusiast
![Open science and audiovisual digital biomarkers enthusiast](https://media1.giphy.com/media/T2qNLJhyUTME2fb0oI/giphy.gif?cid=790b761153688c864956293c22d9c09ffaa0a5163322b17f&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

**I have a Ph.D. in Biomedical engineering and I have a passion for global health initiatives to address health gaps and disparities.**

Like open-source software development, where a community of volunteers who believe in the good of the software contribute their precious time to building upon it,  **I can see world where citizen scientists contribute to open science projects to interrogate a research question, data process, and analyze data in digestible batches with other citizen scientists in other parts of the world, all in the comfort of their home**

Skills: Python/ R/ MATLAB / and data science/machine learning

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the Muscle Dystrophy Association's MOVR Data hub. A notable past project was [OpenDBM](https://github.com/AiCure/open_dbm) and [audiovisual digital biomarkers](https://aicure.com/opendbm/)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the breadth and quality of real-world data (RWD) in neuromuscular diseases (NMD).  I want to be able to apply best practices in RWD analytics and data collection to NMD research.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on academic research publications and apply for grants - within the scope of open biomedical science, NMD RWD analytics, NMD digital biomarker development, or student-mentoring research programs.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with authorship on academic review papers, software development, technical writing, and providing open science research opportunities. 
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about MDA MOVR and how you can join the community. If you talk to me directly and are enthusiastic and committed in collaborating and learning, I know we can find a way to work together.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He / Him
